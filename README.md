## 🌱 App Behavior

Crafters' Dependence: Crafters rely on crop counts. Options won't display in the seed crafter if you have insufficient crops.
Dynamic Updates: The application recalculates the number of crops and potential profit whenever there are changes to the grid or the day.
Bugs: We are aware of certain bugs, especially concerning state refreshes with the crafter, and are actively working on fixes.

## 🔮 What's Next?
Our roadmap includes:

Introducing star seeds to increase profits.
Incorporating fertilizers to enhance your crops.
Unveiling a fresh and vibrant color palette.
